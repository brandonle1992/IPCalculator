IP Calculator

This project is to help calculate a given IP address the subnet mask, broadcast, and gateway with a given amount of subnetwork is required.

Here is an example of the program:

Please type out the IP Address: 106.86.5.33
Please enter the amount of subnetwork is required: 256
Network :  106.86.0.0
Subnet :  255.255.0.0
Gateway :  106.86.0.1
Broadcast :  106.86.255.255

The program can differentiate the class type based off the first octet and will factor that information in.

TODO: Implement a way to have slash notation instead of typing out the require subnetworks.
